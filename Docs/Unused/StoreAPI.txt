 * So, far, this is the ONLY source I've found on how to get
 * package information...
 *   https://stackoverflow.com/a/43249019
 *
 * Ok, there's this too:
 *   https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI
 *
 * Example link:
 *    https://store.steampowered.com/api/packagedetails?packageids=1020633
 *
 * Still, this API doesn't seem to have info for all packages, just some.
