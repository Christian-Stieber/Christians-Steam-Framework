NOTE: I've copied this text from SteamKit, and just adapted the
wording a bit to match my code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SteamGuard works by enforcing a two factor authentication scheme
upon first logon to an account with SG enabled, the steam server will email an authcode to the validated address of the account
this authcode token can be used as the second factor during logon, but the token has a limited time span in which it is valid

after a client logs on using the authcode, the steam server will generate a blob of random data that the client stores called a "sentry file"
this sentry file is then used in all subsequent logons as the second factor
ownership of this file provides proof that the machine being used to logon is owned by the client in question

the usual login flow is thus:
1. connect to the server
2. logon to account with only username and password
at this point, if the account is steamguard protected, the CMsgClientLogonResponse will have a result of AccountLogonDenied
the server will disconnect the client and email the authcode

the login flow must then be restarted:
1. connect to server
2. logon to account using username, password, and authcode
at this point, login wil succeed and a CMsgClientUpdateMachineAuth will be sent with the sentry file data from the steam server
the client will save the file, and reply to the server informing that it has accepted the sentry file

all subsequent logons will use this flow:
1. connect to server
2. logon to account using username, password, and sha-1 hash of the sentry file
